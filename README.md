# DevOps-Practical Project App: Username & Title Generator!

The purpose of this project is to create a simple flask web app utilizing multiple tools that involve concepts like Software Development with Python, Continuous Integration & Cloud Fundamentals. These tools Include:  

- Kanban Board: In this case Trello
- Version Control: Git
- CI Server: Jenkins
- Configuration Management: Ansible
- Cloud server: GCP (Google Cloud Provider) virtual machines
- Containerisation: Docker
- Orchestration Tool: Docker Swarm
- Reverse Proxy: NGINX
- Testing: PyTest, Selenium, Gunicorn

The app itself will be a simple Username & Title Generator where a user can enter their name and can generate a fantasy name based on their own. With that will also come a title they can generate. While this project wont focus too much on the app itself its the back end, development & continuous integration methodology that will shine and be focused on.
